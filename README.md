# HTM-for-Pattern-Recognition
This repository contain the code writed for my bachelor thesis at Universit√† di Camerino. The thesis is about the [Hierarchical Temporal Memory(HTM)](https://numenta.org/hierarchical-temporal-memory/) developed by [Numenta](https://numenta.com/).

Four appplication were created and uploaded in this repository:
* [EventDetectorCampus](EventDetectorCampus): detection of anomalies from time serie data of people that enter and exit from a building;
* [EventDetectorStadium](EventDetectorStadium): detection of anomalies from time serie data about trafic;
* [EletricConsumption](EletricConsumption): prevision of a time serie about electric consumption;
* SeizurePredicion: Prediction of seizure with EEG data.

In each folder a README file give more details about each project and results.
[TesiMorettiniSimone](TesiMorettiniSimone) is the bachelor thesis related to the code in this repository. It's written in italian and it contains the explanation of HTM, the approach used and the results. A english summary is provided inside the README of each project.
